# COVID-19-classification-using-different-ML-classifier
This GitHub repository explores the application of various machine learning classifiers for the classification of COVID-19 cases. The project incorporates two feature extractors, namely Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Image-Based Profiling (IBP), along with image pixel data to develop accurate and efficient models that assist in the classification of COVID-19 patients.

# Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective diagnostic tools. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project focuses on the classification of COVID-19 cases using diverse data sources, including clinical features, laboratory tests, medical imaging, and image pixels.

To achieve robust classification, this project incorporates multiple feature extraction methods:

1- **Statistical Features**: Extracts statistical features from clinical data and laboratory tests, capturing relevant information related to COVID-19 cases.

2- **HOG Features**: Utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm to extract features from medical images, such as chest X-rays or CT scans, capturing shape and edge information for classification.

3- **IBP Features**: Utilizes Image-Based Profiling (IBP) techniques to extract features from medical images, focusing on spatial patterns, textures, and structural information to aid in classification.

In conjunction with the feature extraction methods, the project evaluates seven machine learning classifiers for COVID-19 classification. The classifiers under investigation include, but are not limited to:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* XGB model
