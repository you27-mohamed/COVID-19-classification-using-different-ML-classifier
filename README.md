# COVID-19-classification-using-different-ML-&-DL-classifier
This GitHub repository explores the application of various machine learning classifiers, including pretrained deep learning models, for the classification of COVID-19 cases. The project incorporates popular models such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet152, and DenseNet121 to develop accurate and efficient models that assist in the classification of COVID-19 patients.

# Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective diagnostic tools. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project focuses on the classification of COVID-19 cases using diverse data sources, including clinical features, laboratory tests, medical imaging, and image pixels.

To achieve robust classification, this project incorporates multiple feature extraction methods:

1- **Statistical Features**: Extracts statistical features from clinical data and laboratory tests, capturing relevant information related to COVID-19 cases.

2- **HOG Features**: Utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm to extract features from medical images, such as chest X-rays , capturing shape and edge information for classification.

3- **IBP Features**: Utilizes Image-Based Profiling (IBP) techniques to extract features from medical images, focusing on spatial patterns, textures, and structural information to aid in classification.

In conjunction with the feature extraction methods, the project evaluates seven machine learning classifiers for COVID-19 classification. The classifiers under investigation include, but are not limited to:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* XGB model

To enhance the classification performance, this project integrates pretrained deep learning models into the workflow. Specifically, it utilizes the following models:

* **VGG16**: A convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks.
* **ResNet50**: A deep residual network that can handle deeper architectures with improved accuracy.
* **ResNet152**: An even deeper residual network with increased complexity and the ability to capture intricate features.
* **DenseNet121**: A densely connected convolutional network that facilitates information flow and feature reuse, leading to improved performance.
